Some useful mac tips and apps

## Productivity
* [BetterTouchTool](https://www.boastr.net/) - a powerful tool to create various gestures and actions for touchpad. You can set up middle mouse as `command+v` and another mouse button as `command+c`
* [macpaste](https://github.com/rsmz/macpaste) - enables you to copy and paste with hilighting text and middle mouse. In iTerm2, disable middle-click in Preferences, otherwise you'll get double pastes. This unfortunaly will mess up your clipboards if you are used to hilighling texts randomly, this also creates lots of unnecessary actions.
* [BetterSnapTool](https://www.boastr.net/category/bettersnaptool/)

## Developer
* [Dash](https://kapeli.com/dash) - awesome API documentation browser and code snippet manager.
