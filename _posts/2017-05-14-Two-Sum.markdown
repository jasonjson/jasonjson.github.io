**Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.  You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.**

```python
class Solution(object):
    def twoSum(self, nums, target):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :type target: int
        :rtype: List[int]
        """

        num_index = {}
        for i, num in enumerate(nums):
            diff = target - num
            if diff in num_index:
                return [num_index.get(diff), i]
            else:
                num_index[num] = i
        return []
```
