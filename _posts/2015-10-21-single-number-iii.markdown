<p><strong><em>Given 2n + 2 numbers, every numbers occurs twice except two, find them.</em></strong><br />

public class Solution {
//The two numbers that appear only once must differ at some bit, this is how we can distinguish between them. Otherwise, they will be one of the duplicate numbers.
//Letâ€™s say the at the ith bit, the two desired numbers differ from each other. which means one number has bit i equaling: 0, the other number has bit i equaling 1.
//Thus, all the numbers can be partitioned into two groups according to their bits at location i. the first group consists of all numbers whose bits at i is 0. the second group consists of all numbers whose bits at i is 1.
//Notice that, if a duplicate number has bit i as 0, then, two copies of it will belong to the first group. Similarly, if a duplicate number has bit i as 1, then, two copies of it will belong to the second group.
//by XoRing all numbers in the first group, we can get the first number. by XoRing all numbers in the second group, we can get the second number.
