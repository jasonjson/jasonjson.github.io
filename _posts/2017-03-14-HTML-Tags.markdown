<p><strong><em>Useful Html tags</em></strong></p>

## Basic
* `<html>` wraps all the content on the entire page.
* `<head>` acts as a container for all the stuff you want to include on the HTML page that isn't the content you are showing to your page's viewers. This includes things like keywords and a page description that you want to appear in search results, CSS to style our content, character set declarations, etc.
* `<title>` sets the title of your page, which is the title that appears in the browser tab, and is used to describe the page when you bookmark/favourite it.
* `<body>` contains all the content that you want to show to web users when they visit your page.

## Block elements
* `<p>` defines a paragrah.
* `<form>` creates an form for user input.

## Inline elements
* `<em>` gives the line italic emphasis.
* `<strong>` gives line strong emphasis.
* `<a>` wraps a piece of text around a hyperlink with attributes `<href>` and `<title>`.
* `<img>` inserts an image with attribute `<src>`.

## Table
* `<table>` defines an HTML table.
* `<tr>` defines a row in an HTML table.
* `<th>` defines a header cell in an HTML table.
* `<td>` defines a standard cell in an HTML table.
