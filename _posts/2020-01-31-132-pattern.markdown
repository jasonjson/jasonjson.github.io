Given a sequence of n integers a1, a2, ..., an, a 132 pattern is a subsequence ai, aj, ak such that i < j < k and ai < ak < aj. Design an algorithm that takes a list of n numbers as input and checks whether there is a 132 pattern in the list.

```python
class Solution:
    def find132pattern(self, nums: List[int]) -> bool:
        if not nums:
            return False

        stack = []
        mid = -float("inf")
        for num in reversed(nums):
            if num < mid:
                return True
            while stack and stack[-1] < num:
                mid = stack.pop()
            stack.append(num)
        return False
```
